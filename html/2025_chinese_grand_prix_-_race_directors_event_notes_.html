2025 CHINESE  GRAND PRIX 
21 – 23 March  2025 
  
  
From  The FIA Formula One Race Director     
  
To All Officials, All Teams      Date   20 March  2025 
  
EVENT  NOTES  
General  Instructions  
 
1)       Observing  yellow  flags  
1.1 Single  waved:  Drivers  reduce  their speed  and be prepared  to change  direction.  It must  be 
clear  that a driver has reduced speed and, in order for this to be clear, a driver would be 
expected to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling 
sector.  
1.2 Double waved: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow marshalling sector must 
reduce speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the 
stewards to be satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requiremen ts it must be 
clear that he has not attempted  to set a meaningful  lap time.  Furthermore,  during  sprint 
qualifying , qualifying,  any driver  in a double  yellow sector will have that lap time cancelled.  
1.3 Double Waved during VSC or SC: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow 
marshalling sector  during  a VSC or SC, in addition  to the requirements  in 1.2 above,  must  
remain  positive  of the SECU delta time in the sector concerned.  
 
2) Laps  during  Sprint Qualifying, Qualifying  and Reconnaissance  Lap(s), 
In order to ensure that cars are not driven unnecessarily slowly on in laps during  and after the 
end of sprint qualifying, qualifying or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for 
the sprint and the race, drivers must stay below the maximum time set by the FIA between the 
Safety Car lines shown  on the pit lane map.  
Teams  and Drivers  will be informed  of the maximum  time after the first practice  session.  
For the safe and orderly  conduct  of the Event,  other  than in exceptional  circumstances  accepted  
as such by the Stewards, any driver that exceeds the maximum time from the Second Safety Car 
Line to  the First Safety  Car Line on ANY lap during  and after the end of the sprint qualifying and 
qualifying session,  including  in-laps and out-laps or during  reconnaissance  laps when  the pit exit 
is opened  for the  sprint or  race, may be deemed to be going unnecessarily slowly. For the 
avoidance of doubt, this does not supersede Article 33.4 and Article 37.5 of  the FIA Formula One 
Sporting Regulations,  which  apply  to the entire  Circuit,  furthermore  this includes  the pit lane as 
well. Incidents will normally be investigated after the sprint qualifying , qualifying session , sprint  or 
race.  
 
3) Parc  Fermé  
The Parc Fermé  cameras  must  be always  uncovered  and operational  during  the Event.  
 
4) Lapping  during  the Sprint and the Race  
The ISC requires  drivers  who are caught  by another  car to allow  the faster  driver  past at the first 
available opportunity.  
The F1 marshaling  system  will be set to give a pre-warning  when  the faster  car is within  3.0s of the 


2 
 car about to be lapped, this should be used by the team of the slower car to warn their driver he 
is soon going to be lapped and that allowing the faster car through should be considered a priority. 
When the faster car is within 1.2s of the car about to be  lapped blue  light panels  will be shown to 
the slower car (in addition to blue light panels, blue cockpit lights and a message on the timing 
monitors)  and the driver  must  allow  the following  driver  to overtake  at the first available  
opportunity.  
 
5) Article  55.15  
“In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point 
at which  the lights  on the car are turned  out drivers  must  proceed  at a pace  which  involves  no 
erratic acceleration or braking nor any manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or 
impede the restart ”. 
 
 
 
6) Article  40.8 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 40.8, upon request by the Technical Delegate, the 
Teams  are required  to connect  the umbilical  to the cars and close  the HV contactors  (TR 5.26.5) 
for the sole purpose of checking the car ERS safety status, every morning immediately after the 
covers are removed and the cars are under parc fermé conditions.  
 
Event  Specific  Instructions  
 
7) FIA Outside  Scales  Times  
Should  the outside  scales  be set-up at the pit-lane entrance,  these  will be available  for teams  to 
use at  any time outside  the curfew  times  and the Parc Fermé  cover -up times,  except  for the 30 
minutes preceding the start of the Sprint Qualifying session or Qualifying session and if there are 
support competitions using the pit lane.   
 
 
8) Specific  Technical  Procedures  
Please  note that the FIA have  introduced  an Appendix  Index  File which  contains  all the relevant  
and active Appendix documents, Technical and Sporting Directives. The latest version of this 
Index file (“2025 Formula 1 Appendix – iss 4 – 2025-03-03.xlsx ”) and all relevant documents 
can be found on the FIA SFTP site.  
Competitors  are hereby  required  to ensure  compliance  with these  directives  for the safe and 
orderly conduct of the Event.  
 
9) Support  Races  team  barrier  placement  and Movements  
Team barrier placement prior to and during all support category practice  sessions and races: No 
more than ( 5) five meters from  the garages.   
Please ensure that your pit stop gantry arms are moved back towards the garage during all support 
category activities.  
It is not permitted to push cars to the weighing area at any time a support category is in the pit lane.  
Support Crews and Trolleys will be released into Pit Lane no earlier than 20 minutes prior to the 
opening of Pit Exit for their respective sessions.  
Support Category competition vehicles will be released from the marshalling area no earlier than 


3 
 15 minutes prior to the opening of Pit Exit for their respective sessions.  
10) Practice  starts  
10.1 Practice starts may only be carried out on the asphalt on the RHS of the pit exit before the 
end of  the pit wall and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any time the pit exit is open 
for the sprint  and the race.  
 
                                                         
                                    
10.2 Practice starts  the free practice will be done according  to article 38.3 of Sporting Regulations.  
10.3 If any free practice is resumed with less than 2 minutes remaining, for the purpose of 
facilitating practice starts on the grid as provided for in Article 38.3 of the Sporting 
Regulations, any car wishing to leave the pit lane must proceed down the pit lane and the pit 
exit road without  undue delay and without leaving a significant gap to the car ahead.  
 
11) Article  34.8 SR 
(…) Any car(s)  driven  to the end of the pit lane prior to the start or re-start of the free practice  
session, sprint qualifying or qualifying  session  must  form up in a line in the fast lane and leave  in 
the order they got there (…)  
It is noted  that a car will be considered  to be “in the fast lane”  when  a tyre has crossed  the solid 
white line separating the fast lane from the inner lane, in this context crossing means that all of a 
tyre should be beyond the far side, with respect to the garages, of the line separating the fast lane 
from the inner lane.  
 
                                                 
 
For the avoidance  of doubt,  ISC Appendix  L, Chapter  IV, Article  5b) states  that: 
Once a car has left its garage or pit stop position it should blend into the fast lane as soon as it is 
safe to do so, and without unnecessarily impeding cars which are already in the fast lane.  
Thus, after the start or re -start of a free practice session , sprint qualifying  and qualifying session,  
if there  is a suitable  gap in a queue  of cars in the fast lane,  such  that a driver  can blend  into the 
fast lane safely and without unnecessarily impeding cars already in the fast lane, they are free to 
do so. 
Furthermore, it is noted that during a free practice session sprint qualifying  and qualifying session  
a car driving  in the inner  lane,  parallel  to the fast lane,  will not be considered  to have  blended into 
the fast lane at the earliest opportunity.  
Additionally,  ISC Appendix  L, Chapter  IV, Article  5d) states  that: 
Cars in either the fast lane or working lane may not overtake other cars in the fast lane except in 
exceptional circumstances.  
In this context  a “stopped  car” is one which  has an obvious  mechanical  problem.

pit lane .     
 
                                               
                                            
12.6 During the reconnaissance laps prior to the sprint and the race drivers are allowed to cross 
the white line  separating the pit exit road from the circuit .                                            
                                           
13) Post  Sprint Qualifying  and Qualifying drivers  weighing  
Any driver who finished participating in the qualifying sessions after SQ1, SQ2, Q1 and Q2 must 
proceed through the pit lane directly to the FIA scales immediately after  they have  returned  to 
their team’s  garage.  The drivers  may not drink  anything  or do anything which increases their 
weight before it is recorded by the FIA. 
Any driver,  who stops  on the track  during  the sprint  qualifying  sessions  or qualifying  sessions  and 
is not required to visit the Medical Centre, must proceed to the FIA scales to get his weight 
recorded before returning to his team.  
Drivers  who finish  within  the top 10 must  proceed  to the FIA scales  immediately  when  out of their 
cars without contact with any other person.
